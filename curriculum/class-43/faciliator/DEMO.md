# DEMOS - Gatsby and Next

## Execution

Demos are provided in the `demo` folder in the guide repository. You'll need to run them locally instead of at Code Sandbox to get the full impact.

## Next.js (`demo/next.js`)

Lean on the [docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/) to show your students where to find the how on each of these steps. The goal here is half to teach them Next.js and half to teach them how to figure something new out.

* Begin by creating a new project `npx create-next-app`
* Create a couple of pages in the `pages` folder
* Break out the header/footer
* Optionally, create a custom document so you don't have to repeatedly add the header/footer to every 'page'


## Gatsby (`demo/gatsby`)

Lean on the [docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/) to show your students where to find the how on each of these steps. The goal here is half to teach them Gatsby and half to teach them how to figure something new out.

**Get Rolling**

* Install the Gatsby CLI. `npm install -g gatsby-cli`
* Create a new site. `gatsby new gatsby-site`
* Change directories into site folder. `cd gatsby-site`
* Start development server. `gatsby develop`

**Get Coding**

* [Create 2 pages](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/recipes/#creating-pages-automatically) in the src/pages folder
  * index.js (/ home page, almost just like next)
  * words.js (/words ... same core content as you did for next)
* Create a markdown page [docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/adding-markdown-pages/)
