## Lab Notes

Lab for this class is very wide open. We really just want the students to make something quick and dirty with both frameworks.

Their barrier to entry is low (it's still just React) but we want to get the students in tune with reading docs and learning how to apply the things they know how to do with something they may not be 100% familiar with.

## Preparation
* Run the Gatsby and Next Demos
* Gatsby has some unique features to it, in the way that it spins up content driven sites with markdown as it's data source. Read up and practice with it.
