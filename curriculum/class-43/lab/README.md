# LAB - Server Side React

React is great, but it's a client-side application, which has a negative impact on SEO -- only an empty div is actually ever sent to the browser, and your React app fills in the content on the fly.

For content driven sites, such as a Blog or a news site, where its important to have search engines like Google and Bing  properly index your site, you must render full HTML on the server side and send all of that content to the browser.
