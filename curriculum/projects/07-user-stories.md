# Group Project: Begin User Stories
The next step in the continued preparations for your group project is to begin to generate user stories.

## Tasks
Create user stories that cover the functionality of your website. Your user stories should be in the form of simple sentences in the form `As a <user category> I want to <action> so that I can <business purpose>`. Including all three details in each user story help to clarify for whom the story is written, and the specific business purpose the functionality is intended to address. Do not forget developer-facing user stories like “as a developer I want to have one-command app deployment so I can re-deploy to production at will”.

If you have chosen to use an Agile tool like Trello or Scrumdo, write the stories there. It is equally valid to use github issues or milestones, or even a google doc, a paper notebook, or sticky notes. In general, tangling with complex management tools is a bit of overkill for a week-long project like this, so keep it simple.

## Submitting Your Work
**This is a group submission. Only one person must submit for group credit**

If you have an online resource where we can review your user stories, provide a link to it. Otherwise, make a list of user stories and paste them into the text box. Please include your team name an a link to your repository as well.
