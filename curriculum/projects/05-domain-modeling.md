# Group Project: Begin Wireframes
The next step in the continued preparations for your group project is to begin to generate wireframes for each page in your application.

## Tasks
Wireframes allow you to experiment with the look and feel of a website without committing any code. You can use an online or desktop tool, such as Moqups.com or Mockingbird. Or you can use paper and pen.

Storyboards combine individual wireframes into diagrams of the flow of a user through your website. As your wireframes become more complete, consider combining them into story boards that show the various ways in which a user might interact with your site. These will help to inform your creation of User Stories as preparations for your project continue.

## Submitting Your Work
**This is a group submission. Only one person must submit for group credit**

If you have created wireframes online, please submit a link to them (in progress is fine, they need not be complete yet).

If you have created pen-and-paper wireframes, take a quick picture of them and upload that.
