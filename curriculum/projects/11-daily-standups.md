# Group Project: Daily Standup
It is now time to work on your group project.

## Tasks
As your project progresses, hold daily “stand-up” meetings. A stand-up meeting should take no more than 10-15 minutes. The purpose is to facilitate communications among team members about the ongoing work of the project.

In a stand-up meeting each person will, in turn, present:

- A brief statement of what they worked on yesterday.
- A brief statement of what they plan on working on today.
- A brief statement of “blockers”, issues that are preventing them completing some task.

If there are questions that arise from these statements, or if you have any questions for the team, hold them until after this first round of reporting. Once all team members have reported, return to any questions that need answering. Once all questions are answered, call an end to the meeting and move on to work.

Avoid turning your statements into play-by-play analysis of each activity. Keep things brief and quick.

An instructor or a TA must attend your stand-up meeting. Do not hold one without a member of the teaching team present.

## Submitting Your Work
There is no submission for this assignment. Members of the teaching team will give credit to all members present in the meetings.

However, you may have questions, concerns, comments or issues that you need us to hear. If this is the case, you may come to us directly, or use the comment system in Canvas to write to us. Please comment on an assignment that is not yet graded to ensure we see your comments.
