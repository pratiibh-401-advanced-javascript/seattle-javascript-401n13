# Group Project: Iteration Planning
The next step in the continued preparations for your group project is to plan your project schedule, and put a test-driven development plan together for the application.

## Tasks
You’ve wireframed, storyboarded, created user stories, made estimates and laid out a priority. Now it’s time to make a final plan for your projects.

Each member of your team will choose a story from the top of the priority order. For your story, your job is to do a “task breakdown” of the work you will do to complete the story. For each task you identify, create an issue in GitHub. If your team has a labelling strategy, use it appropriately. Make sure you have enough work for one to two days. Do not plan much further ahead than that. This avoids the need to undo work in the event that the situation on the ground changes.

As you work through your project, you will pick up your tasks and do them in whatever order makes sense. You will work on a branch of your repository, to avoid causing conflicts with your teammates work. Once you have completed all the tasks for a single user story, you will submit a pull request. Your team will review the work and make suggestions. You will make any needed adjustments. When all is ready, your teammates can merge your pull request and you can move on to another story.

## Submitting Your Work
**This is a group submission. Only one person must submit for group credit**

Please provide a list of the stories you will work on and the tasks you see as being required to complete them, including a BDD framework (no assertions required at this point) for your application. This can be a list of issues in GitHub, or another project management tool, or a text submission.
